**Brain Tumor Classification App using CNN algorithm**

A flutter application which efficiently categorizes MRI scanned images of brain and predicts for brain tumor and specifies the type of the tumor.

- The application is embedded with a custom Convolution Neural Network model build using keras and Tensorflow.
- The model achieved an accuracy of 0.82 in the classification of various types of brain tumor.
- Used the tflite package to integrate the python ML model.
